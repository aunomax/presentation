# Critical mass for Keller–Segel systems with supercritical nonlinear sensitivity

 

We consider a Neumann initial boundary problem for a radially symmetric chemotaxis system with supercritical sensitivity. We prove that there exists a critical mass m such that for arbitrary decreasing nonnegative initial data with mass larger than m, the solution blows up in finite time, and such that for some decreasing nonnegative initial data with mass less than m, the solution exists globally. Our results extend that of Winkler’s paper [Winkler, Math. Ann., 373 (2019), 1237-1282], where he proved similar results for the system with linear sensitivity.
